This is a new branch for izumi to practice of git.

Some of the many uses of Markdown are:
1. readme files
2. Writing messages in online discussion forums
3. Creating rich text using a plain text editor, emails, and technical documentation.

Popular sites that use Markdown include GitHub, Trello, Reddit, SourceForge, and StackExchange.
Markdown parsers also support dropping in blocks of HTML code that add to Markdown’s limited syntax if you want to achieve a more complex design.

Syntax:
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
####### Heading level 6

Paragraph 1
Paragraph 2

Line 1
Line 2

-Just add a dash first and then write a text.

-If you add another dash in the following line, you will have another item in the list.
    - If you add four spaces or use a tab key, you will create an indented list.
        - If you need sert an indenta list within an intended one, just press a tab key again.

Sometimes you want bullet points:

*Start a line with a star
*Profit!
